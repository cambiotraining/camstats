# Overview

These sessions are intended to enable you to perform additional data analysis techniques appropriately and confidently using R.

- Ongoing formative assessment exercises
- No formal assessment

- No mathematical derivations
- No pen and paper calculations

They are **not** a “how to mindlessly use a stats program” course!

## Core aims
:::highlight
To know what to do when presented with an non-standard dataset e.g.

1. Know how to deal with non-normal data
2. Know how to analyse count data
3. Be able to deal with random effects
:::

## Core topics

1. [Generalised linear models](#ms1-intro)


## Datasets {#index-datasets}

This course uses various data sets. The easiest way of accessing these is by creating an R-project in RStudio. Then download the `data` folder [here](morestats_data.zip) by right-clicking on the link and <kbd>Save as...</kbd>. Next unzip the file and copy it into your working directory. Your data should then be accessible via `<working-directory-name>/data`.
