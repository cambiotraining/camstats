## Purpose and aim
This is a statistical technique for reducing the dimensionality of a data set. The technique aims to find a new set of variables for describing the data. These new variables are made from a weighted sum of the old variables. The weighting is chosen so that the new variables can be ranked in terms of importance in that the first new variable is chosen to account for as much variation in the data as possible. Then the second new variable is chosen to account for as much of the remaining variation in the data as possible, and so on until there are as many new variables as old variables.

## Data
First we need some data! To liven things up a bit, we'll be using data from the `palmerpenguins` package. This package has a whole bunch of data on penguins. What's not to love?

::::: {.panelset}
::: {.panel}
[Penguins]{.panel-name}
The `penguins` data set comes from `palmerpenguins` package (for more information, see [the GitHub page](https://github.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins)).
:::
:::::

## Visualise the data
First of all, let's have a look at the data. It is always a good idea to get a sense of what your data look like.

::::: {.panelset}
::: {.panel}
[tidyverse]{.panel-name}
First, we load and inspect the data:
```{r}
# attach the data
data(package = 'palmerpenguins')

# inspect the data
penguins
```
:::
:::::

We can see that there are different kinds of variables, both factors and numerical. Also, there appear to be some missing data in the data set, so we probably have to deal with that.

Lastly, we should be careful with the `year` column: it is recognised as a numerical column (because it contains numbers), but we should view it as a factor, since the years have a categorical meaning.

To get a better sense of our data we could plot all the numerical variables against each other, to see if there is any possible correlation between them. However, there are quite a few of them, so it might be easier to just create a correlation matrix.

::::: {.panelset}

::: {.panel}
[tidyverse]{.panel-name}
First, we load the `corrr` package, which allows us to plot a correlation matrix using the `tidyverse` syntax:

```{r}
library(corrr)

penguins_corr <- penguins %>%
  select(where(is.numeric)) %>%  # select the numerical columns
  correlate() %>%                # calculate the correlations
  shave()

# plot the correlation matrix
penguins_corr %>%
  rplot()
```

We get a message (not an error) that the correlation method used is `pearson`, which is the default. We also get a message about how the missing values are treated, with only complete pairwise comparisons made.

Lastly, when plotting the matrix we also get a message about `ggplot()` not knowing how to automatically pick a scale - and defaulting to continuous. That's fine with us, since the correlation coefficients are on a continuous scale.
:::
:::::

We can see that there is, for example, a strong positive correlation between `flipper_length_mm` and `body_mass_g`. Other variable combinations seem reasonably well-correlated, such as `flipper_length_mm` and `bill_length_mm` (positive) or `flipper_length_mm` and `bill_depth_mm` (negative).

When there are so many different variables that appear to be correlated or, if you just have lots of variables in your data and you don't know where to look, then it can be useful to reduce the number of variables. We can do this with dimension reduction methods, of which Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is one.

Basically, a PCA replaces your original variables with new ones: the principal components. These principal components consist of parts of your original variables.

You could compare this with a smoothy consisting of, let's say, 80% orange, 10% strawberry and 10% banana (no kale).

Similarly, our new principal component could consist of 80% `flipper_length_mm`, 10% `body_mass_g` and 10% `bill_depth_mm` (still no kale).

## Performing the PCA

::::: {.panelset}

::: {.panel}
[tidyverse]{.panel-name}
Before we perform the PCA, we'll use a few `recipe()` pre-processing steps:

1. remove any NA values
2. centre all predictors
3. scale all predictors

```{r}
penguin_recipe <-
  # take all variables
  recipe(~ ., data = penguins) %>% 
  # specify the ID columns (non-numerical)
  update_role(species, island, sex, year, new_role = "id") %>% 
  # remove missing values
  step_naomit(all_predictors()) %>% 
  # scale the data
  step_normalize(all_predictors()) %>%
  # perform the PCA
  step_pca(all_predictors(), id = "pca") %>% 
  # prepares the recipe by estimating the required parameters
  prep()

penguin_pca <- 
  penguin_recipe %>% 
  tidy(id = "pca") 

penguin_pca
```
:::
:::::

## Visualising PCs
Now that we've performed our PCA, we can have a bit of a closer look. A useful way of looking at how much your PCs (principal components) are contributing to the amount of variance that is being explained is to create a _screeplot_. Basically, this plots the percentage of explained variance for each PC.

::::: {.panelset}

::: {.panel}
[tidyverse]{.panel-name}
We can extract the relevant data directly from the `penguin_recipe` object:
```{r}
penguin_recipe %>% 
  tidy(id = "pca", type = "variance") %>% 
  filter(terms == "percent variance") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = component, y = value)) + 
  geom_col() + 
  xlim(c(0, 5)) +
  ylab("% of total variance")
```
:::
:::::

By definition, the first principal component (PC1) will always explain the largest amount of variation. In this case, PC1 explains almost 70% of our variance!

That's pretty good going, since it means that instead of having to look at four variables, we could look at just one but still capture 70% of the variance in our data. The number of variables in our data set is very manageable, so we probably wouldn't do this. However, if you have a data set with hundreds of variables, then seeing if they can be described well by using PCs is a very useful thing to do.

## Loadings
Let's think back to our smoothy metaphor. Remember how the smoothy was made up of various fruits - just like our PCs are made up of parts of our original variables.

Let's, for the sake of illustrating this, assume the following for PC1:

| parts| variable|
|:- |:- |
| 4 | `flipper_length_mm` |
| 1 | `body_mass_g` |

Each PC has something called an **eigenvector**, which in simplest terms is a line with a certain direction and length.

If we want to calculate the length of the eigenvector for PC1, we can employ Pythagoras (well, not directly, just his legacy). This gives:

$eigenvector \, PC1 = \sqrt{4^2 + 1^2} = 4.12$

The **loading scores** for PC1 are the "parts" scaled for this length, _i.e._:

| scaled parts| variable|
|:- |:- |
| 4 / 4.12 = 0.97 | `flipper_length_mm` |
| 1 / 4.12 = 0.24 | `body_mass_g` |

What we can do with these values is plot the loadings for each of the original variables. For example, if we plotted PC1 against PC2, and wanted to see how much the original variables contribute to each principal component, we would do the following:

::::: {.panelset}

::: {.panel}
[tidyverse]{.panel-name}
The loadings are encoded in the `value` column of the pca object (`penguin_pca`). To plot this, we need the data in a "wide" format:
```{r}
# get pca loadings into wider format
pca_wider <- penguin_pca %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = component, id_cols = terms)

pca_wider
```

We can see that there are four terms (our original variables) and four PCs. This makes sense, because the maximum number of principal components cannot exceed the number of original variables.

We need to do a bit more data gymnastics, with defining an arrow style (vectors are represented using arrows), plotting the PCs, and plotting the loadings.

Arrow:
```{r}
# define arrow style
arrow_style <- arrow(length = unit(2, "mm"),
                     type = "closed")
```

To plot PC1 vs PC2, we need to extract the relevant data. All of the PCA-related data is stored in the `penguin_recipe` object. Since the people who developed `tidymodels` are quite fond of verbs (I'm really more of an adjective kind-of-guy myself...) they invented the `bake()` function.

The logic is: you follow a `recipe()` and then you `bake()` it. Yes, I know.

Anyways, we use this to get the data from our `penguin_recipe`, telling the function that it shouldn't expect any new data (the function is also used in model testing, where data is split in a training and test data set).

```{r}
bake(penguin_recipe, new_data = NULL)
```

It spits out the original table, but with the PC values instead of the original variables. We can then use that information to plot the PCs, focussing here on PC1 vs PC2:

```{r}
pca_plot <-
  bake(penguin_recipe, new_data = NULL) %>%
  ggplot(aes(PC1, PC2)) +
  geom_point(aes(colour = species), # colour the data
             alpha = 0.8,           # add transparency
             size = 2)              # make the data points bigger

pca_plot
```

Lastly (finally), we take this plot and add the loading data on top of it:

```{r}
pca_plot +
  # define the vector
  geom_segment(data = pca_wider,
               aes(xend = PC1, yend = PC2), 
               x = 0, 
               y = 0, 
               arrow = arrow_style) + 
  # add the text labels
  geom_text(data = pca_wider,
            aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, label = terms), 
            hjust = 0, 
            vjust = 1,
            size = 5) 
```
:::
:::::

Slightly annoyingly, this can cause some overlap in the labels. Also, if there are many different variables than this, it'll become rather tricky to interpret because there will be a web of vectors.

But here things look pretty OK still. One thing that is immediately obvious from these data is that the Gentoo penguins PCs are quite distinct from the Adelie and Chinstrap penguins.

From a PC-perspective, the `flipper_length_mm` and `body_mass_g` variables make up most of PC1, since the vectors are almost horizontal.

In contrast, `bill_length_mm` and `bill_depth_mm` contribute a lot to PC2. They also contribute positively (`bill_length_mm`) and negatively (`bill_depth_mm`) to PC1.

As mentioned, the vectors can become a bit messy in terms of visualisation. So it can be useful to represent the loadings differently. Note that, at this point, I'm not aware of a method that allows you to do this reasonably straightforward in anything other than R's tidyverse.

::::: {.panelset}

::: {.panel}
[tidyverse]{.panel-name}
For the following to work, we need to load the `tidytext` libary. You can do this as follows:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(tidytext)
```

```{r}
penguin_pca %>%
  mutate(terms = reorder_within(terms, 
                                abs(value), 
                                component)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(abs(value), terms, fill = value > 0)) +
  geom_col() +
  facet_wrap(~ component, scales = "free_y") +
  tidytext::scale_y_reordered() +
  labs(
    x = "Absolute value of contribution",
    y = NULL, fill = "Positive?"
  ) 
```

This gives us the loadings for each variable, facetted by principal component. The reason that we're plotting the _absolute_ values, is so that we can compare positive and negative contributions. For each PC the absolute loadings are sorted in descending order. To distinguish between positive and negative loadings we use colours.

:::note
It is important to keep the amount of variance explained by each PC in mind. For example, PC3 only explains around 9% of the variance. So although bill length and body mass contribute substantially to PC3, the contribution of PC3 itself remains small.

## Exercise: Heptathlon

:::exercise ::::::

First of all, heptathlon is an actual word. Seven sports events in one go! This is an old data set that keeps track of the scores/times of 25 athletes in a heptathlon event. I can't remember when the data were collected, but the main reason that I've kept it is to show how fleeting the concept of 'country' is. A good proportion of the countries no longer exist...

Let's not get too philosophical but see what we can do with this data set. I would like you to do the following:

1. load the data
2. create a correlation matrix and visualise the most highly correlated pair
3. perform a PCA
4. create a screeplot and see how many PCs would be best
5. calculate the loadings for PC1 and PC2 and visualise them

<details><summary>Answer</summary>

::::: {.panelset}

::: {.panel}
[tidyverse]{.panel-name}

### Load the data
1. load the data
```{r, message=FALSE}
hept <- read_csv("data/heptathlon.csv")

hept
```

Note how many country codes have changed (URS, GDR, FRG!). Also, humbug, HOL or 'Holland' is not a country, The Netherlands is!. Have a search and see how the world is constantly changing...

### Correlations
2. create a correlation matrix and visualise the most highly correlated pair
```{r}
hept_corr <- hept %>%
  select(where(is.numeric)) %>%  # select the numerical columns
  correlate() %>%                # calculate the correlations
  rearrange()                    # arrange highly correlated variables together

hept_corr
```

Looking at the correlation matrix, the most highly correlated pair is `longjump` and `hurdles` (-0.91). We could (and should) do this programmatically, but it's a small matrix and life is short.

```{r}
ggplot(data = hept,
       aes(x = longjump,
           y = hurdles)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "longjump vs hurdles")
```

So it seems that the better you are at the long jump, the faster (and thus better) you are at the hurdles. I guess that makes sense and it would be interesting to have some data on leg length to see if there is some correlation there...

### PCA
3. perform a PCA
```{r}
hept_recipe <-
  # take all variables
  recipe(~ ., data = hept) %>% 
  # specify the ID columns (non-numerical)
  update_role(athlete, new_role = "id") %>% 
  # remove missing values
  step_naomit(all_predictors()) %>% 
  # scale the data
  step_normalize(all_predictors()) %>%
  # perform the PCA
  step_pca(all_predictors(), id = "pca") %>% 
  # prepares the recipe by estimating the required parameters
  prep()

hept_pca <- 
  hept_recipe %>% 
  tidy(id = "pca") 

hept_pca
```

### Screeplot
4. create a screeplot and see how many PCs would be best
```{r}
hept_recipe %>% 
  tidy(id = "pca", type = "variance") %>% 
  filter(terms == "percent variance") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = component, y = value)) + 
  geom_col() + 
  ylab("% of total variance")
```

It's clear that PC1 explains a heck of a lot of the variance in our data (around 65%). PC2 then explains a bit more, just under 20%. So these two PCs combined explain about 85% of the variance in our data, which is pretty good.

Things get a bit less clear as we go "up" in the PCs: PC3 and PC4 explain roughly the same amount of variance, so if we'd include PC3 then we should also include PC4. However, since they only explain around 8% of the variance they do not contribute much, so we leave it at PC1 and PC2.

### Loadings
5. calculate the loadings for PC1 and PC2 and visualise them

With 7 original variables, plotting PC1 and PC2 with their loadings would be a bit unclear. So in this case we'll just create a bar chart for each PC and the absolute contributions of each original variable.

```{r}
hept_pca %>%
  filter(component %in% c("PC1", "PC2")) %>% 
  mutate(terms = reorder_within(terms, 
                                abs(value), 
                                component)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(abs(value), terms, fill = value > 0)) +
  geom_col() +
  facet_wrap(~ component, scales = "free_y") +
  tidytext::scale_y_reordered() +
  labs(
    x = "Absolute value of contribution",
    y = NULL, fill = "Positive?"
  ) 
```

Just to illustrate that this is much more informative than drawing vectors:

```{r}
# get pca loadings into wider format
pca_wider <- hept_pca %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = component, id_cols = terms)

pca_plot <-
  bake(hept_recipe, new_data = NULL) %>%
  ggplot(aes(PC1, PC2)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.8, # add transparency
             size = 2)    # make the data points bigger

# define arrow style
arrow_style <- arrow(length = unit(2, "mm"),
                     type = "closed")

pca_plot +
  # define the vector
  geom_segment(data = pca_wider,
               aes(xend = PC1, yend = PC2), 
               x = 0, 
               y = 0, 
               arrow = arrow_style,
               colour = "red") + 
  # add the text labels
  geom_text(data = pca_wider,
            aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, label = terms), 
            hjust = 0, 
            vjust = 1,
            size = 5) 
```

Told ya.
:::
:::::

### Conclusion
Well, what can we conclude here? First of all, it's worth noting that there are only 25 observations and 7 variables, so that limits our analysis a bit.

We can see that PC1 (particularly when combined with PC2) is able to explain quite a big chunk of the variance in our data. However, we should keep in mind that each observation is an individual athlete. So ideally we would want to plot the names of the athletes on the PC1 vs PC2 plot and see how their individual performances in the 7 events compare.

That, is for another day.
