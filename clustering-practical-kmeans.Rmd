## Workflow
K-means clustering is an iterative process. It follows the following steps:

1. Select the number of clusters to identify (e.g. K = 3)
2. Create centroids
3. Place centroids randomly in your data
4. Assign each data point to the closest centroid
5. Calculate the centroid of each new cluster
6. Repeat steps 4-5 until the clusters do not change

## Data
First we need some data! To liven things up a bit, we'll be using data from the `modeldata` package. This package has a whole bunch of interesting datasets for us to look at. I'll be using the `penguins` dataset to illustrate the K-means clustering, but I've highlighted some other data sets that you can try this on yourself.

::::: {.panelset}
::: {.panel}
[penguins]{.panel-name}
```{r}
# attach the data
data("penguins")
```
:::

::: {.panel}
[Alzheimer's]{.panel-name}
```{r}
# attach the data
data("ad_data")
```

## Visualise the data
First of all, let's have a look at the data. It is always a good idea to get a sense of how your data.

::::: {.panelset}
::: {.panel}
[tidyverse]{.panel-name}
```{r}
penguins
```
:::

::: {.panel}
[base R]{.panel-name}
```{r}
head(penguins)
```
:::

:::::

So we have different types of penguins, from different islands. Bill and flipper measurements were taken, and the penguins' weight plus sex was recorded.

So let's have a look at flipper length versus bill length, as an example.

::::: {.panelset}
::: {.panel}
[tidyverse]{.panel-name}
```{r, warning = FALSE}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = flipper_length_mm,
                     y = bill_length_mm,
                     colour = species)) +
  geom_point()
```
:::

::: {.panel}
[base R]{.panel-name}
```{r}
plot(penguins$flipper_length_mm,  # scatter plot
     penguins$bill_length_mm,
     pch = 20,
     col = penguins$species)      # colour by species

legend("bottomright",             # legend
       legend = levels(penguins$species),
       pch = 20,
       col = factor(levels(penguins$species)))
```
:::
:::::

We can already see that the data appear to cluster quite closely by species. A great example to illustrate K-means clustering (you'd almost think I chose the example on purpose!)

## Clustering

Next, we'll do the actual clustering.

::::: {.panelset}

::: {.panel}
[tidyverse]{.panel-name}
To do the clustering, we'll be using the `kmeans()` function. This function requires numeric data as its input.

```{r}
points <- penguins %>% 
  select(flipper_length_mm,      # select data
         bill_length_mm) %>% 
  drop_na()                      # remove missing values

kclust <- kmeans(points,         # perform k-means clustering
                   centers = 3)  # using 3 centers

summary(kclust)                  # summarise output
```

Note that the output is a list of vectors, with differing lengths. That's because they contain different types of information:

* `cluster` contains information about each point
* `centers`, `withinss`, and `size` contain information about each cluster
* `totss`, `tot.withinss`, `betweenss`, and `iter` contain information about the full clustering

  na.omit()                      # remove missing data

  kmeans(points_r,               # perform k-means clustering

## Visualise clusters
We can visualise the clusters that we calculated above.

::::: {.panelset}
::: {.panel}
[tidyverse]{.panel-name}
When we performed the clustering, the centers were calculated. These values give the (x, y) coordinates of the centroids.

```{r}
tidy_clust <- tidy(kclust) # get centroid coordinates

tidy_clust
```

:::note
The initial centroids get randomly placed in the data. This, combined with the iterative nature of the process, means that the values that you will see are going to be slightly different from the values here. That's normal!
:::

Next, we want to visualise the which data points belong to which cluster. We can do that as follows:

```{r}
kclust %>%                              # take clustering data
  augment(points) %>%                   # combine with original data
  ggplot(aes(x = flipper_length_mm,     # plot the original data
             y = bill_length_mm)) +
  geom_point(aes(colour = .cluster)) +  # colour by classification
  geom_point(data = tidy_clust,
             size = 7, shape = "x")     # add the cluster centers
```
:::

::: {.panel}
[base R]{.panel-name}
When we performed the clustering, the centers were calculated. These values give the (x, y) coordinates of the centroids.

```{r}
kclust_r$centers  # get centroid coordinates
```

:::note
The initial centroids get randomly placed in the data. This, combined with the iterative nature of the process, means that the values that you will see are going to be slightly different from the values here. That's normal!
:::

Next, we want to visualise the which data points belong to which cluster. We can do that as follows:

```{r}
plot(points_r,                # plot original data
     col = kclust_r$cluster,  # colour by cluster
     pch = 20)

points(kclust_r$centers,      # add cluster centers
       pch = 4,
       lwd = 3)
```

## Optimising cluster number
In the example we set the number of clusters to 3. This made sense, because the data already visually separated in roughly three groups - one for each species.

However, it might be that the cluster number to choose is a lot less obvious. In that case it would be helpful to explore clustering your data into a range of clusters.

::::: {.panelset}
::: {.panel}
[tidyverse]{.panel-name}
```{r}
#tidy explore
```
:::

::: {.panel}
[base R]{.panel-name}
```{r}
#baseR explore
```
:::
:::::

From the exploration we can see that three clusters are optimal in this scenario.
