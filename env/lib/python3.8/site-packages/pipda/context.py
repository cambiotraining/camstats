"""Provides the context to evaluate f.A and f['A']

By default,
1. in the context of select, both f.A and f['A'] return 'A'
2. in the context of evaluation, f.A returns data.A and f['A'] returns data['A']
3. when context is mixed, meaning *args is evaluated with select and
   **kwargs is evaluated with evaluation.
4. when it is unset, you will need to evaluate args and kwargs yourself.
